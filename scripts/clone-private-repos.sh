# These are NOT submodules. This repo is public; a private submodule puts its URL in a public
# .gitmodules and makes `git clone --recursive` fail for everyone without access — on a repo
# published so that others can use it. The submodule's pinned SHA buys little for either of
# these: both are wanted at HEAD, and neither is built against a pinned version of the other.
#
# Absent or unreachable, each is skipped and the script still exits 0. A machine without access
# gets a working esetup with these two features missing, which is the correct outcome — not a
# failed bootstrap.

# Idempotent: re-running fast-forwards a clean clone and leaves a dirty one alone.
